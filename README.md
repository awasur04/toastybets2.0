# toastybets2.0
New and improved toastybets discord bot

# Config file template
Create a new file under the main directory named config.json, put the following code inside your file.
```
{
	"token": "secret-token-goes-here",
	"clientId": "client-id-goes-here",
	"guildId": "guild-id-goes-here"
}
```
Note: The guildId is not required and can be left as is.
This is what your project directory should look like https://i.imgur.com/6DkRuV0.png
